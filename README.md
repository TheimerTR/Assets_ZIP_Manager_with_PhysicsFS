# PhysicsFS_Personal_Project
 Description Hi! Welcome to this repository! Here you will find a short implementation of PhysicsFS in video games. That project was made for the purpose of an activity of the assignment of Project 2 in the center CITM-UPC, Terrassa. About me  I am Alberto Hidalgo, a current second year student to become video game developer, at the center of CITM-UPC Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain. In the future Iâ€™m focused to become a programmer in the industry of gaming, and make my own little experiences.
